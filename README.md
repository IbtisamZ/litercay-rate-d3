# Literacy Rates Visualization (D3 + React)
A responsive scatter plot showing **literacy rates among young men vs. women (2023)**. The visualization highlights trends across continents using interactive and animated charts.

## Tools & Approach
- **React**: Handles DOM rendering and user interactivity
- **D3.js**: Computes scales and data transformations (logic only, React handles the DOM)
- **Framer Motion**: Smooth animations for circles and labels
- **Vite + Yarn**: Fast, modern frontend setup

## Setup
This project uses **Vite** as the build tool and **Yarn** as the package manager.

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn

# Start development server
yarn dev
